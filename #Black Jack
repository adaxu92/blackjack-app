#Black Jack


##Description

This is a simple game of Black Jack. The objective of this game  is to try to beat the dealer comparing both hand's added number values. However if player's total values over 21, this is considered a 'bust' and loses the game as a result. This rule also applies to the dealer. The 'deal' button will draw 4 cards from the shuffled deck and deal two to the player and two to the dealer. The 'hit' button will draw 1 card and added onto the player and dealers hand. The 'stand' button will compare both total values. Whoever has the highest total wins. Exceptions are if the dealer has 21, then it is an automatic win.
